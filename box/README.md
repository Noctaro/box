If you want to use the RTC Module, you have to run setserial.ino one time. Here you can set the date via serialmonitor. Read the header information in setserial for more info ;) Btw. the pins are the same like in the main code.

You will need these libraries:

SHT 31 library https://github.com/hawesg/SHT31D_Particle_Photon_ClosedCube

Streaming library http://arduiniana.org/Streaming/Streaming5.zip

Time library https://codeload.github.com/PaulStoffregen/Time/zip/v1.5

DS1302RTC library http://playground.arduino.cc/uploads/Main/DS1302RTC.zip

Sensor: SHT31 D

Clock Module: DS1302
